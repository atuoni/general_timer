# General Timer Project
## About
This is a repository with a microcontroller firmware of a timer device. It was built using a Microchip PIC12F675 microcontroller. The code was written in C language and was used the MPLABX to compile and build the program. 
The code comments is in portuguese language.

## How it works
The device only has a push button to set and start the counting time. You can set two modes for counting (5 minutes or 10 minutes) pressing the button more than 10 seconds, so the blink led will show the mode selected. After a new press of the button, the timer counting starts and the AC output is turned on. After the timer gets the time selected the AC output is turned off. You also can cancel the timer operation pressing the button for more than 10 seconds during the counting time.
